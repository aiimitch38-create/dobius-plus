/**
 * Status color + label constants used by the cross-session status dots —
 * tab status (TerminalTabBar), grid pane status (ProjectView), and session
 * dashboard (Sessions). One source of truth so the three places can't drift.
 *
 * NOTE: these intentionally differ from Mission Control / Board View, where
 * green = working (an agent is actively running). In the monitoring suite,
 * green = done (Claude finished its turn cleanly) — matching the at-a-glance
 * traffic-light semantics most users expect.
 *
 * Hex values mirror the theme's accent/success/danger tokens.
