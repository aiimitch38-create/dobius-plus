/**
 * auto-resume.js, v1.0.30.
 *
 * On app launch, after every project window has restored and its tabs have
 * been recreated, walk every live terminal and re-engage the Claude session
 * that was running in it at quit time. Staggered so 14 PTYs don't spawn
 * `claude --resume <id>` simultaneously and overwhelm the API / SSD / Mac.
 *
 * Data sources:
 *   - sessionTabMap (config) records every {sessionId -> tabId, projectPath}
 *     link, captured by store.resumeSession AND by setupSessionTabCapture's
 *     15s background scan in main.js. So a tab the user resumed once gets
 *     its mapping persisted across quit.
 *   - listTerminals() (terminal-manager) reports which PTYs are alive in
 *     the new launch.
 *   - getSessionSize(sessionId, projectPath) (data-service) probes both
 *     encoder forms of the project dir and stats the transcript file.
 *
 * Per-tab status flows on the existing tabStatus channel:
 *   'queued'  -> dot is purple, scheduled but not yet sent
 *   'working' -> set when the `claude --resume` write fires
 *   The 'done' / 'needs' transitions are owned by the OSC hook in
 *   useTabActivity once Claude responds, so we don't push them here.
 *
 * Cancellation:
 *   - Per-tab: cancelTabIfPending(tabId) called from terminal:write IPC
 *     when the user types BEFORE the scheduled write fires.
 *   - Global: cancelAll() called from a Cmd+Shift+R IPC.
 *   - Window close: caller invokes cancelTabsForProject(projectPath).
