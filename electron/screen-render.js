//
// Why this exists: the mobile selector popups were parsed by regexing an
// ANSI-stripped rolling buffer. That works for a frame drawn in one pass, but
// Ink repaints INCREMENTALLY: on a multi-question AskUserQuestion, question
// two arrives as cursor-positioned cell updates that never form a complete
// line in a linear strip, so the second question's popup simply never
// appeared on the phone (Sam, 8/14). An emulator replays the same bytes the
// way the terminal did: absolute positioning lands, erase sequences actually
// ERASE (so an answered prompt disappears instead of lingering as "stale"
// text), and reading the grid back gives the true current screen.
//
// Main-process only. One pooled Terminal, reset per call: construction is the
// expensive part, reset is cheap. Callers are the mobile selector paths,
// which run at most a few times per second for one tab.

// @xterm/headless ships CJS with no named ESM exports; default-import and
// destructure (same interop pattern Node and Electron main both honor).

// concurrent selector probes (tab A and tab B, or two phones) would otherwise
// interleave reset/write on the same grid and tab A's probe could read tab

// prompt (Codex High). A render is fast (<50ms typical, 750ms worst), so a
// simple promise chain is enough.
